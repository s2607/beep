Super simple beep program
cc0 Stephen Wiley
It's expected to be used for mail and command completion notification, it needs alsa and aplay to work.

USAGE:
   beep freq duration
freq is in HZ, duration is in seconds. All arguments are floating point decimal

note: in older versions the frequency was off by a factor of 2pi, this has been corrected and the output was verified with a spectograph.

DOWNLOADING AND COMPILING: 
As someone with no write access to /usr/lcal/bin
  git clone https://github.com/s2607/beep.git
  cd beep
  ./inst.sh

INSTALLING
  sudo ./inst.sh

USING IT TO BEEP ON NEW MAIL:
Replace the command in your crontab with a modified version of mail.sh
